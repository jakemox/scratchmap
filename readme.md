ScratchMapp is an app that lets users visually explore the world, look at details of countries on a map view and save the countries they've visited by clicking them on the map. For each country, users can explore the top activities in the capital city. Cities can also be found using a search functionality, and user's progress on a journey to visit all the world's countries can be tracked in a profile view.

The app is still a work in progress. A functioning test version is currently deployed at [http://scratchmapp.data4you.cz/](http://scratchmapp.data4you.cz/)

## Code

- Back-end was written in PHP using the Laravel MVC framework.
- Map functionality was created with the [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) platform. 
- Front end code is written in plain Javascript and some React components (with a conversion to a full React app in consideration)
- Content has mostly been collected from public APIs - attractions from [Google Places](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search), city pictures using [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/)
- App is responsive and mobile use has been taken into consideration at all stages of the design.
